Firmware for Split Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboards

This repository contains custom keymaps that I have created for the firmware of split ergonomic mechanical keyboards I have built.

The keymaps I have written are based in C
* QMK (https://qmk.fm/) is used for my wired keyboard builds.
* ZMK (https://zmk.dev/) is used for my wireless (bluetooth) keyboard builds
